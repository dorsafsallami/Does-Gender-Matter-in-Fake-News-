# [Does Gender Matter? Examining and Mitigating Gender Bias in Fake News Detection]() 

The proliferation of fake news poses significant challenges
to both individuals and society. While numerous studies have developed
detection models and datasets, these models often remain vulnerable
to biases introduced by contaminated data sources or biased training
methodologies. When trained on such data, machine learning models can
unintentionally learn and propagate these biases, negatively impacting
their generalization performance. Existing research on fake news detection has predominantly focused on political bias. This study addresses
gender bias in fake news detection. While gender bias is well-documented
in media, it remains largely unexamined in the context of fake news. Our
investigation reveals that gender bias exists within fake news detection
models, with models trained on female data outperforming those trained
on male data. In response, we propose mitigating gender bias using an
adversarial debaising approach. Our results demonstrate improved fairness and performance metrics compared to baseline models.
